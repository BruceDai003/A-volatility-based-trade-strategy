# A-volatility-based-trade-strategy


- A simple trade strategy based on volatility by selling call option and longing future. It's my second project during my internship at CITIC Securities.

- The idea and theory background of the project is a research report written by an analyst from Guotai Junan Securities. It's almost toy code that there is numbers of hard-coding that need improving.
